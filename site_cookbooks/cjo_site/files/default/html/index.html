<p>I have been helping my clients get organized since 2004.  When I started out as a Professional Organizer, I soon learned that much of the work I was doing was actually daily money managing.  My very first organizing client had a real problem with processing her mail and paying her bills on time.  She had dozens of paper bags stuffed with unpaid bills, junk mail, and taxes going back over ten years.  In helping her to get her home office organized and her bills paid, I began my career as a Daily Money Manager.  Paper is just another "possession" that needs a home, and as a DMM I can help you get your paper under control and get your bills paid on time.</p>
