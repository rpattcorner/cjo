<h2>Need a Daily Money Manager?  <br/>Want to get organized?</h2>

<p>Call me at <span class="tel">301-263-9482</span> or <a class="email" href="mailto:melanie@dorsetwest.com">e-mail me</a> to discuss your needs.</p>

<h2>My Philosophy</h2>

<p>I bring my background as an editor to my work as an organizer. I see each room as a page, the clutter as a jumble of words waiting to be edited. My goal is a happy client in a room that is clear and concise, with lots of white space.</p>	

<p>I had been organizing myself, my friends, and my family for decades when I started my organizing business in January 2004. My grandmother, one of the most organized people I've ever known, taught me <em>&quot;A place for everything, and everything in its place&quot;</em> when I was a little girl, and I dedicate my company to her.</p>

<p>I believe that homes get cluttered because you don't have a &quot;home&quot; for all your possessions. I can help you decide which of your things you want to keep, which rooms they should live in, and where in each room they should be kept. I believe in using simple and individualized systems, common sense, and the proper containers for the job.</p>

<p>Each client is different, with different needs and learning styles. I will talk with you to determine your unique needs and then work with you to clear out clutter and create a home that is orderly and serene. <em>You</em> decide which of your things you want to keep, sell, donate, or throw out.</p>
